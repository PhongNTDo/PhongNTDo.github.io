Welcome! I am an ***AI Researcher at Zalo AI & UIT@NLP*** at Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. I have been a researcher at [UIT@NLP lab](https://nlp.uit.edu.vn/home) during my undergraduate degree at [University of Information Technology](https://www.uit.edu.vn/). After receiving my bachelor's degree in computer science, I have continued to do part-time research at this lab until now. In parallel, I have worked as an AI researcher at [Zalo AI](https://zalo.ai/), Vietnam for 3+ years.


Research Interests
======
I’m passionate about building intelligent retrieval systems that can reason, generalize across modalities and languages, and interact with structured knowledge. My research focuses on two major directions: enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and exploring the intersection between Artificial Intelligence and Geography.

- **🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** I'm interested in advancing RAG systems to make retrieval more intelligent, interpretable, and adaptable to complex data types.

  - **📘 Knowledge Graph Reasoning:** Leveraging structured knowledge graphs to support logical reasoning and evidence chaining during retrieval.

  - **🌐 Multilingual & Multimodal Embedding:** Designing unified embedding spaces for cross-language and cross-modal semantic search - enabling systems to search across text, images, and more.


- **🗺️ AI and Geography:** As a geography enthusiast, exploring the intersection between spatial intelligence and artificial intelligence.

  - **🧭 Spatial RAG & Geographic Question Answering:** Developing systems that understand and retrieve geospatial information, enabling models to answer geography-based questions and reason over maps, locations, and spatial relationships.
