Welcome! I am an ***AI Researcher at Zalo AI & UIT@NLP*** at Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. I have been a researcher at [UIT@NLP lab](https://nlp.uit.edu.vn/home) during my undergraduate degree at [University of Information Technology](https://www.uit.edu.vn/). After receiving my bachelor's degree in computer science, I have continued to do part-time research at this lab until now. In parallel, I have worked as an AI researcher at [Zalo AI](https://zalo.ai/), Vietnam for two years.

Currently, I am also looking for an opportunity for a PhD position in the field of AI and NLP, especially Large Language Model.


Research Interests
======
My research centers on developing a robust question-answering system capable of effectively processing and understanding various forms of unstructured data, including text, images, audio, tables, and code. Through deep-learning techniques and advanced reasoning capabilities, I aim to create a system that can provide comprehensive and accurate responses to a wide range of user queries.

- **Multimodel Integration**: my research explores the integration of large language models (LLMs) with multimodal processing to leverage the strengths of both approaches. By combining the contextual understanding of LLMs with specialized agents designed for image, table, and chart analysis, I seek to enhance the system's ability to reason and provide informative responses.

- **Retrieval & Large Language Model**: I am investigating retrieval-augmented generation techniques to improve the factual accuracy and coherence of the system's outputs. By incorporating relevant information from external sources, I aim to minimize hallucinations and ensure that the system's responses are grounded in evidence.
